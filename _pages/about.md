For the moment, I am working as a computational chemistry expert for [Covestro](https://www.covestro.com/en) Digital R&D (DRD) Team located in APAC region. I received my Doctorate degree (Dr. rer. nat) in the department of Theoretical Chemistry from Freie Universität Berlin in late 2021. After graduation, I conducted postdoctoral research continuously under the supervision of [Prof.Dr.Beate Paulus](https://www.bcp.fu-berlin.de/en/chemie/chemie/forschung/PhysTheoChem/agpaulus/group-members/head/beate-paulus.html). My research interests focus on the electronic structures as well as the transport properties of novel materials. I have a broad knowledge of different computational methods, ranging from periodic and molecular electronic structure calculations (both DFT and wavefunction-based methods) to transport calculations and the evaluation of excitonic properties with GW-BSE. In addition, I am dedicated to the method development of local current analysis based on Non-Equilibrium Green’s Function as well as automated workflows for quantum chemistry calculations. 

I have published 8 articles in scientific journals such as The Journal of Physical Chemistry C (JPCC), Journal of Computational Chemistry (JCC), The Journal 
of Chemical Physics (JCC) and Journal of the American Chemical Society(JACS).

To be or not to be?<br>
The world moves through time, but time itself is unaffected

The world moves through time, but time itself remains unaffected—a constant, forward-moving axis. We, however, are in a perpetual state of motion within it—caught in the flow of events, decisions, and tasks that often feel overwhelming. As we strive to achieve our goals, investing our precious time and energy into various activities, we sometimes find ourselves questioning the value of our efforts. Some endeavors yield little to no results, while others end in failure. Naturally, we ask: Why should I try again? And if I do, how do I navigate a world full of distractions and infinite possibilities?
